Hello There! Thank you for visiting my Github page.

This page is dedicated to hosting some of my code written for datascience/ML projects that I've done over the past few years.

My interest in this field is the amalgamation of different skills acquired over the years, some intentionally and some by extension of the work I had been doing. Analysis, programming, optimization and numerical methods. Working for engineering analysis departments of various large companies, analysis and computer-aided engineering had always been the foundation of what I've been doing. Around 2013, when I hadn't heard of datascience yet and python popularity hadn't exploded, I began scripting in python - writing scripts to automate various engineering workflows, performing calculations for engineering analyses and even teaching classes!

Over the years, I was intrigued by the newly emerging (at that time) datascience field and I felt like something I could channel my strengths into. In 2019, I formally enrolled myself into a 1 year grueling datascience postgraduate programme - one developed by the business school of the University of Texas, Austin and delivered by Greatlakes institute. Since then, I've been using my datascience skills in my workplace at every opportunity possible and there has been no looking back!
