Hello There! Thank you for visiting my Github page.

This page is dedicated to hosting some of my code written for datascience/ML projects that I've done over the past few years.
My interest in this field is the amalgamation of different skills acquired over the years as a computational mechanical analysis engineer, some intentionally and some by extension of the work I had been doing. Programming, analysis, optimization, numerical methods and were things I did everyday. Being an engineer for the engineering analysis departments of various large companies, numerical method and computer-aided engineering had always been the foundation of what I've been doing. Around 2013, when I hadn't heard of datascience yet and python popularity hadn't exploded, I started my programming journey in python - writing scripts to automate various engineering workflows and performing calculations for engineering analyses.

As years went by, I was intrigued by the newly emerging (at that time) datascience field and I felt like something I could channel my strengths into. In 2019, I finally bit the bait and enrolled myself into a formal 1 year grueling datascience postgraduate programme developed by the business school of the University of Texas, Austin. Since then, I've been using my datascience skills in my workplace at every opportunity possible and there has been no looking back!
